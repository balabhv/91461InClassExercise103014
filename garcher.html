            <h3>The definition of GAR (UrbanDictionary):</h3>
            <div>A term used towards male characters and individuals who are so overwhelmingly manly that your own masculinity is absolutely *buried*, leaving you naught but a whimpering, swooning girl-child before them.

                Originated in 4chan's /a/ board. A poster was describing his feelings towards the Fate/Stay Night character Archer, and mistyped <q>gay</q> as <q>gar</q>.
                <div id="quotes">
                    <q>Episode 14 left me totally gar for Archer.</q>
                    <q>You are gar for badasses, but gay for traps.</q></div></div>
