                Unlimited Blade Works: Infinite Creation of Swords
                (無限の剣製アンリミテッドブレイドワークス, ?) is the Reality Marble/Noble Phantasm of 
                Heroic Spirit EMIYA. EMIYA does not have a true Noble Phantasm that is the 
                crystallized embodiment of a hero's existence like many demonic or holy swords, 
                but if a Noble Phantasm is considered to be a symbol of the Heroic Spirit, 
                then the Reality Marble is his Noble Phantasm. 
                It is high-class thaumaturgy that embodies their internal worlds and imprints them 
                upon the world as a bounded field. It is their one true specialization of magecraft, 
                the result of "Sword" being both their Origin and their Elemental Affinity, and the 
                basis of their projection and reinforcement skills. It is the definite answer obtained 
                by someone whose life was saved by a sword, actually merged and lived with a sword, 
                and acted as a sword all of his life. EMIYA has no penalties from the world while 
                utilizing his version of Unlimited Blade Works.

                <h3>Archer's Aria:</h3>

                <div>Steel is my body and fire is my blood</div>
                <div>I have created over a thousand blades</div>
