            <h3>About Archer</h3>
            <p>
                Archer is not a proper Heroic Spirit in the sense of other heroes. 
                His true identity is that of Shirou Emiya (衛宮 士郎, Emiya Shirō?) 
                of an alternate timeline from that of Fate/stay night who made a contract 
                with the world and became the Heroic Spirit EMIYA (エミヤ, ?). 
                He acts as a Counter Guardian for the world as payment for the contract. 
                He is summoned because he still has the jewel pendant that Rin used to save 
                his life after Lancer stabbed his heart. The jewel he owns is the actual catalyst 
                used for his summoning rather than the one that Rin still has at the time of 
                his summoning. After the end of each of the three routes in Fate/stay night, 
                the possibility for Shirou to become Archer still exists, but the chance of 
                it happening is close to zero.</p>
            <p>
                Shirou Emiya won the Holy Grail War along with his Servant Saber, eventually 
                going on to work as a freelance magus to pursue his dream of becoming an Ally 
                of Justice. He stubbornly trained himself while pursuing his dream of saving 
                mankind, but later fell into despair upon realizing that his abilities were 
                insufficient in fulfilling his goal. Sometime in his twenties, he received 
                his signature red overcoat as a gift from Ciel of the Church. He at some 
                point encountered and fought beings similar to Angra Mainyu, but he was 
                forced to retreat when he was unable to act against them. He later gained 
                some understanding of such beings as targets of the Counter Force upon 
                entering the Throne of Heroes.</p>
            <p>In his early thirties, he had to make a life changing decision. 
                Confronted by a calamity which had the potential of killing one hundred 
                people before him, he decided to "make a contract" with the World to become a 
                hero capable of producing miracles and become a Heroic Spirit after his death. 
                He believed he could save both the lives of the dying people before him and save 
                even more as a hero after his death. Although he desperately fought to end a war, 
                he was in turn branded as the mastermind behind that war and subsequently executed 
                because of the betrayal of his allies. Although he died of betrayal, he did not hate 
                mankind. However, the “World” ironically gave him the duty as a Heroic Spirit 
                <q>to slaughter all humans at a particular location when mankind is at the threshold 
                    of complete self destruction</q>, a <q>Counter Guardian</q>.</p>
            <p>His belief that he would continue to save many people as a Heroic Spirit did happen, 
                but it was through being made to clean up after human actions and forced to take 
                many lives to save humanity as a whole, instead of <q>saving everyone</q> - 
                protecting humans without having to cause deaths of humans as he would have liked to.
                After seeing human self-destruction and forced to oppose his own ideals countless times,
                he began to deny himself and his ideal. Even knowing that the Throne of Heroes was 
                isolated from time and space, Archer desperately came to believe that his only hope of 
                release was to have himself summoned into an era where Shirou Emiya exists and kill his 
                past self, hoping that the double paradox created by Shirou Emiya being killed before 
                having a chance to make the contract with Alaya and that the killing was done by a 
                Shirou Emiya who successfully made the contract with the world would create a time 
                paradox great enough in magnitude that could potentially erase his existence 
                as a Counter Guardian.
